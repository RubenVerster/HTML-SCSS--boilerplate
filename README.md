# Project Created Working Through The ADVANCED CSS COURSE from Jonas

This course handles everything you need to achieve Senior skills in CSS and SCSS

## Running Projefct Locally

If you plan on working on this project further, there is a script command for running the project locally and automatically compiling the SCSS to CSS.
Run 'npm run start' to run the live server locally and then have the SCSS compiler running

This project can be found live on https://rubenverster.github.io/Natours-advanced-css/
I will be referencing back to this project a lot.
Jonas! If I meet you in person someday, I'm buying you a round of beers!
